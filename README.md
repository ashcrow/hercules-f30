# hercules-f30
These are some very simple but specific helper scripts and configurations to install F30 for s390x inside the hercules emulator.

This was inspired by Daniel Horak's earlier work with F20 which he documented here:

More recent Fedora releases make use of newer s390x features that are not properly emulated by the 3.x series of hercules.

As a result, to use these scripts and instructions, you'll need to install the in-progress 4.x rpm-ification from here:
